# labStarter
Resources to promote openness and inclusion within biology labs. This repo is being curated in collaboration with the [first cohort](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-1) of the Open Life Sciences program! 

## Vision statement
I am working with my OLS mentor (@fpsom) to develop a resource for academics to build an open and inclusive community in their lab, whether it be for research or education. The goal would be to produce a website on GitHub that contains templates for enabling open science practices within a lab community (e.g., Code of Conduct, list of resources for commonly asked questions, open lab notebooks) in addition to clear contribution guidelines to encourage engagement from the broader community. Benefactors of this project would include junior faculty currently setting up new labs, senior faculty seeking to increase inclusivity of their lab, and early career researchers looking to prepare for teaching or leading their own labs in the future.
